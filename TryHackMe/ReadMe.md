## TryHackMe — Hands-On Cybersecurity Learning
### Overview
This folder documents my practical cybersecurity learning using TryHackMe.

TryHackMe is the main platform I use to move beyond theory and develop hands-on skills through guided labs, simulations, and structured learning paths.

Each path and room completed here is documented with:
- What I learned
- Why it matters in real-world cybersecurity
- Practical examples (when applicable)
- Evidence such as screenshots

This is part of my larger cybersecurity portfolio and reflects active, ongoing learning.

### Why TryHackMe
I use TryHackMe because it:
- Emphasizes learning by doing
- Introduces tools in context, not in isolation
- Mirrors real-world security thinking
- Builds strong foundations before specialization

Rather than chasing tools or certificates, my focus is on:
- Understanding problems
- Thinking like a security analyst
- Applying concepts practically

### Learning Paths & Progress
[📂Pre-Security (In Progress)](https://github.com/cybernuel2005/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/tree/main/TryHackMe/Pre%20Security)

The Pre-Security path focuses on building core foundations required for any cybersecurity role.


### Documentation Standard
For every TryHackMe section:
- Concepts are explained in README files
- Practical labs are documented in separate .md files
- Screenshots are included as proof

This keeps the portfolio clear, honest, and easy to review.


## Note
This folder will grow over time. New learning paths will be added.
