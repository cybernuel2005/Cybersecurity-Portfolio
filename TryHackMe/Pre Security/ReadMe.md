## Pre-Security — Foundations of Cybersecurity
### Overview
The Pre-Security learning path on TryHackMe is focused on building the core foundations required to understand cybersecurity properly.

### This stage is about:
- Understanding how systems work
- Learning how networks and the web function
- Getting comfortable with Linux and Windows
- Developing the right cybersecurity mindset before specialization

This section documents my progress through the Pre-Security path and serves as the base layer for all future cybersecurity learning.

### Purpose of Pre-Security
- Cybersecurity skills cannot be built on weak fundamentals.
- The goal of this path is to:
- Remove gaps in basic technical knowledge
- Build confidence with core concepts
- Prepare for more advanced paths such as SOC-level learning
- Avoid learning tools blindly without understanding the systems behind them

This phase prioritizes understanding over speed.

### Sections Covered in This Path
The Pre-Security path is divided into the following major sections.
Each section has its own folder with structured documentation.

[1️⃣ Introduction to Cybersecurity](https://github.com/cybernuel2005/Cybersecurity-Portfolio/tree/main/TryHackMe/Pre%20Security/Introduction%20To%20Cybersecurity)

This section introduces the core ideas of cybersecurity and how the field is structured.

Key focus areas:
- Defensive Security concepts
- Offensive Security concepts
- Overview of cybersecurity career paths
- Real-world relevance of security roles

2️⃣ Network Fundamentals

This section focuses on understanding how networks operate, which is essential for detecting and investigating security issues.

Key focus areas:
- How devices communicate
- IP addressing and protocols
- Network traffic basics
- Why networking knowledge is critical for security analysis

3️⃣ How the Web Works

This section explains how the internet and web applications function at a fundamental level.

Key focus areas:
- How browsers communicate with servers
- HTTP and HTTPS concepts
- How websites deliver content
- Why web fundamentals matter in cybersecurity

4️⃣ Linux Fundamentals

Linux is widely used in servers, security tools, and cloud environments.

This section focuses on:
- Navigating the Linux command line
- Understanding file systems
