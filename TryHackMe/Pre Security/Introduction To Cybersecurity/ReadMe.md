## Defensive Security

Defensive security focuses on detecting, monitoring, and responding to threats
within an organization’s systems and networks.

Key responsibilities include:
- Monitoring logs and alerts
- Investigating suspicious activity
- Identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Escalating incidents when necessary

To apply these concepts practically, I completed a SIEM-based investigation:
