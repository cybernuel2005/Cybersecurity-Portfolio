## Defensive Security - 03-02-2026

Defensive security focuses on detecting, monitoring, and responding to threats
within an organization’s systems and networks.

Key responsibilities include:
- Monitoring logs and alerts
- Investigating suspicious activity
- Identifying Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
- Escalating incidents when necessary

To apply this concept practically, I completed a SIEM-based investigation:

## Offensive Security - 04-01-2026
Offensive security focuses on breaking into systems, finding bugs in software and applications, and exploiting loopholes to gain unauthorized access. 

The goal here is to:
- Think like a hacker
- And enhance the system defenses

To apply this concept practically, I completed an attack using a dirb tool/command:
