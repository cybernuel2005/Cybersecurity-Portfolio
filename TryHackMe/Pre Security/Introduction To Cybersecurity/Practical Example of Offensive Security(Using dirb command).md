# Practical Example of Offensive Security - 04-02-2026

## Objective
- Using the dirb command to find hidden URLs if they exist in a website

## What I Learned
- A Terminal is a command-line program used to send text-based commands to a computer
- A wordlist is a collection of common passwords or words used in security testing to check system security in a guessing attack 

## Challenges
- I thought wordlists were only used by attackers

## Tools / Commands
- dirb "website url"

## Real-World Relevance
 - To discover hidden or exposed directories that may increase a website’s attack surface.


## Screenshots
- Site to unauthorizely access

)

- using the dirb command in the terminal to see if the site is vulnerable

)

- Site showing two hidden URLs that are vulnerable

) 

- Using the hidden URL to unauthorizely transfer money
