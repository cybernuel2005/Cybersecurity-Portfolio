## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Portfolio — Asare Emmanuel (Cybernuel)
### About This Portfolio

This repository documents my hands-on journey into cybersecurity. My formal education is largely theoretical, so this portfolio exists to show: 
- what I am actively learning,
- how I think about cybersecurity problems,
- and how I turn knowledge into practical skill.

This is not a finished portfolio.
It is a living record of growth.

Everything here reflects real learning — no exaggeration, no fake expertise.

### My Learning Approach
I am focused on:
- Building strong foundations first
- Learning cybersecurity by doing, not just reading
- Understanding why tools are used, not just how
- Documenting progress clearly and honestly

I follow structured learning paths and treat each project as evidence of skill development.

### Current Focus
- Cybersecurity fundamentals
- Defensive security concepts
- SOC-oriented thinking
- Practical labs and simulations
- Clear documentation of what I learn

### Projects & Learning Paths
This section contains everything I actively work on.
- New projects will be added.
